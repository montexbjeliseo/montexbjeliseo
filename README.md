## About me
I am Eliseo, a full stack web developer. I develop complete web applications using different technologies such as Java, Spring, Javascript, React, Angular, Astro, Python, Django, HTML, CSS, GIT, etc.

I consider myself a proactive, adaptive and collaborative person. I enjoy learning and teaching.
